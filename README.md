# COVID19-Global-Forecasting

This is one of the two complementary forecasting tasks to predict COVID-19 spread. This task is based on various regions across the world. To start on a single state-level subcomponent, please see the companion forecasting task for California, USA.
Background

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicineâ€™s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
